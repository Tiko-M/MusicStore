<br><br><h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards</br>
But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign</br>
Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines</br>
Because I miss you all the time</br>

<h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
So, get away</br>
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know</br>
And let yourself go</br>
You know you didn't lose your self-control</br>
Let's start at the rainbow</br>
Turn away</br>
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go</br>
Let yourself go</br>
Is that a compromise</br>

<h2>[Chorus]</h2>
So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view</br>
There's a party soon, do you wanna go?</br>
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?</br>
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go</br>
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house</br>
And I hopе this works out</br>
But you know how much you broke me apart</br>
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you</br>
I don't wanna know</br>

<h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter</br>
'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide</br>
So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies</br>
And why do I so want to call you (Call you, call you, call you)</br>


<h2>[Chorus]</h2>
So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view</br>
There's a party soon, do you wanna go?</br>
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?</br>
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go</br>
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house</br>
And I hopе this works out</br>
But you know how much you broke me apart</br>
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you</br>
I don't wanna know</br>

<h2>[Bridge]</h2>
You</br>
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh</br>
I don't know why I'm no-one</br>

<h2>[Pre-Chorus]</h2>
So, get away</br>
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know</br>
And let yourself go</br>
You know you didn't lose your self-control</br>
Let's start at the rainbow</br>
Turn away</br>
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go</br>
Let yourself go</br>
Is that a compromise</br>

<h2>[Chorus]</h2>
So what do you wanna do, what's your point-of-view</br>
There's a party soon, do you wanna go?</br>
A handshake with you, what's your point-of-view?</br>
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go</br>
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house</br>
And I hopе this works out</br>
But you know how much you broke me apart</br>
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you</br>
I don't wanna know</br>
