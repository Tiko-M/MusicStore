    <br><h2>[Intro: Bladee]</h2>
    Can't you see it?</br>
Bad dog, but for you I'm obedient</br>
Trash Star, cross my heart, that's the reason</br>
Look up at the stars, they're retreating</br>
Don't get lost, don't live what I'm preaching</br>
Drain Jesus, ice me immediately</br>
Can't even come home when it's freezing</br>
925, burn me my medallion</br>

<h2>[Verse 1: Bladee]</h2>
Smell like spray paint, yeah, what I'm off of</br>
Link at the gas stop, won't stop, I can't stop</br>
Can't even see clear where I'm at though</br>
This not a mansion, it's a castle</br>
You a fuckboy, I heard it from Ecco</br>
Drain Show, no face, came through the back door</br>
We can't even bring no girls in my section</br>
Feel like OD9, I'm a dragon</br>
Can't even talk to myself 'cause I'm wrong now</br>
White gate calling me, won't be long now</br>
I can't even put those words in my songs now</br>
Big strong compounds, life force get crossed out</br>
Siren calling, ambulance sound</br>
Drain Gang track you down like a Bloodhound</br>
I can't even trust myself when the night comes</br>
Four doors, red or blue, pick the right one</br>
It's some writing on the wall, it said "Die scum"</br>
No heart, but I do wish I had one</br>
And my baby wanna know what I'm scared of</br>
Don't worry, it's been taken care of</br>
Bladee, I'm coming for the trash like a trashman</br>
Hell Gang, put that back in the trash can</br>
I can't even trust myself when the night comes</br>
Step on my head twice like a cockroach</br>

<h2>[Verse 2: Ecco2k]</h2>
Every time I close my eyes, I stop existing</br>
Every now and again, I can tell the difference</br>
Woke up falling, I'm still falling off of buildings</br>
Want a new addiction, want to fall victim</br>
Something you might crush my heart but I'ma risk it</br>
And I'm still sinking, need a curse lifted</br>
Blacklisted at all the clubs, but I can fix this</br>
Think I need stitches, pray to three sixes</br>
I wanna see heads roll, execute past life</br>
Hundred white birds, ninety-nine fall out the sky</br>
Fast life, race against time, it will outrun you</br>
Rains return to the earth, sunlight to the underworld</br>
Maybe in another life we could be lovers</br>
Ever since we met, these thoughts keep getting worse</br>
Iron will, ironed shirt, now I want a Fendi purse</br>
I don't talk with empty words, what is any of it worth?</br>
Every time I close my eyes, I go to prison</br>
Every now and again, I can feel the distance</br>
Woke up running, I'm still running through the system</br>
Want a new sickness, want to fall victim</br>
Somewhere, someone broke your heart but I'ma fix it</br>
And I'm still wishing for that first kiss</br>
Get blacklisted at all the clubs in Seven Sisters</br>
Industry children play with three sixes</br>

<h2>[Outro: Ecco2k]</h2>
Every time I close my eyes, I stop existing</br>
