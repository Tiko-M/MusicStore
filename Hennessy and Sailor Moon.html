<br><h2>[Chorus: Yung Lean]</h2>
I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you</br>
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true</br>
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you</br>
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through</br>
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you</br>
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true</br>
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you</br>
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through</br>

<h2>[Verse 1: Yung Lean]</h2>
I be, I be grinding, making money, it's for me and you</br>
I love the way you dancing and your top is see-through</br>
We can go up to the stars, see clouds and fall through</br>
Money in my pocket and you know I want you</br>
I've been busy, got so much work, I can't always be with you</br>
Percocets my system, when I go to sleep I know it's you</br>
When I was in the hospital, I saw you</br>
I know what you feel inside 'cause I feel you</br>
I gotta stay true, my money rain blue</br>
Hennessy and Sailor Moon, I just wanna be with you</br>
I know what your feelings are 'cause I know I feel you</br>
My money rain blue, Hennessy and Sailor Moon</br>

<h2>[Chorus: Yung Lean & Bladee]</h2>
I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you</br>
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true</br>
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you</br>
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through</br>
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you</br>
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true</br>
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you (All I ever see)</br>
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through</br>

<h2>[Verse 2: Bladee]</h2>
She shouldn't have to ask, whatever she wants</br>
I stay up till dawn, barbed wire on my arm</br>
They wanna see me fall, they wanna see me fall</br>
I don't care at all, I'm a young rockstar</br>
Livin' in the dark, livin' in the dark</br>
Leandoer the God, we've been goin' hard</br>
Ever since she called, I don't have a heart</br>
I went to the stars</br>
What you want from me? I can get it for you</br>
Get-get-get-get-get it for you</br>
You-you-you don't, you don't want me, do you? (Do you?)</br>
You don't want me, do you? (Do you?)</br>
Know what I'll do to you</br>

<h2>[Chorus: Yung Lean]</h2>
I-I-I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you (Fiending for you)</br>
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true (Don't know if it's true)</br>
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you</br>
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through</br>
I love how she dancing, got me fiending for you (Fiending for you)</br>
You say that you love me, I don't know if it's true (Don't know if it's true)</br>
When I go to sleep all I ever see is you</br>
I can be your savior, everything that we've been through</br>
